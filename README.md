# TypeScript-Basics-and-OOP-Concepts

This repository is a comprehensive resource for learning TypeScript, covering fundamental concepts and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. 

It serves as a self-learning tool and a platform for sharing knowledge with others interested in mastering TypeScript development. 

Explore TypeScript basics, dive into OOP concepts, and advance your skills in building robust and scalable applications with TypeScript.

# What is TypeScript

TypeScript is a programming language developed by Microsoft that builds on JavaScript by adding features like static typing. 
It helps catch errors early in development, making code more reliable. 
TypeScript is easy to learn for JavaScript developers and offers additional tools for building large-scale applications with fewer bugs.

## Setting Up the Development Environment 

**Install Node.js and npm:**


TypeScript is typically installed and managed using npm (Node Package Manager),
so you'll need to install Node.js which includes npm. You can download and install Node.js from the official website: 
Node.js Downloads (https://nodejs.org/en)

**Install TypeScript:**

Once Node.js and npm are installed, you can install TypeScript globally using npm. 
Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command:

``` npm install -g typescript ```

This command will install TypeScript globally on your system, allowing you to use the TypeScript compiler (tsc) from any directory.

**Verify TypeScript Installation:**

After installing TypeScript, you can verify the installation by running the following command in your terminal:

``` tsc --version ```

This command will display the installed version of TypeScript, confirming that it's installed correctly.

**Editor/IDE Setup:**

Next, you'll need to set up your preferred code editor or integrated development environment (IDE) to work with TypeScript. 
Popular choices include Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, Atom, or WebStorm. Many editors offer TypeScript support out of the box, but you may need to install additional extensions or plugins for full functionality.
